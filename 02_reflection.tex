\section{Placeholder Reflection}

The practical exercises and coding assignments provided hands-on experience in implementing machine learning algorithms. Working through these exercises helped me gain a deeper understanding of the concepts covered in the lectures and reinforced my ability to apply them in real-world scenarios.

Additionally, the discussions and interactions with fellow classmates during the tutorials were valuable in expanding my perspective on different approaches and techniques in machine learning. Collaborating with others allowed me to learn from their experiences and gain insights that I may not have considered on my own.

Overall, Week 1 provided a solid foundation for the rest of the course and has motivated me to further explore the field of machine learning. I am excited to continue learning and applying these concepts in future modules.
